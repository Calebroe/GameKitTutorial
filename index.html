        GameKit enriches iOS games by enabling social gaming features. 
        It's crucial for engaging users in a more interactive and competitive environment. 
        For a game like 2048, GameKit can significantly enhance the gaming experience 
        by adding a social dimension through leaderboards and achievements, 
        motivating players to improve their skills and engage more deeply with the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 2048 game, a simple yet addictive puzzle, will integrate GameKit to enhance user 
        engagement through the Game Center. We'll add achievements for reaching key milestones 
        (like achieving the 2048 tile), and leaderboards to foster a competitive environment. 
        This will not only increase the game’s replayability but also leverage the social aspect 
        of gaming by allowing players to compare their scores with friends and the global player base.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
        This section will delve into the specifics of adding GameKit features to the 2048 game, 
        demonstrating how to make a simple game more engaging and competitive.

        <br>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
          We'll use the latest Xcode version and Swift 5, targeting iOS 14 and above. 
          We'll guide you through setting up GameKit in your project, 
          ensuring you have all the necessary tools and dependencies installed.
          <br>
          In order to add Game Center to your app you will first need to create an app on App Store Connect. 
          This will require that you have an Apple Developer account. Once you have logged in you will go 
          to the “My Apps” section and create a new app. In this creation you will link the app using 
          your unique “bundle identifier” which you can find inside your XCode project under “Signing & Capabilities.
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          While creating your app, make sure to give it permissions for “Game Center”. 
          For the purposes of this tutorial the app will require no other permissions other than Game Center.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now that your app has been created you will need to add Game Center to the app itself inside of Xcode. 
          To do this you will again go to the “Signing & Capabilities” page under your project. Once here you will 
          need to click on the “Team” dropdown menu and, if you haven’t added your account yet, you will need to 
          add your account. After your account has been added you will need to select it in this dropdown menu. 
          Now, you will click on the “+ Capability” button which can be found near the top-left of the image above.
          <br>
          <br>

          <br>
          This will bring up the capabilities search menu. You can either scroll through the options and find “Game Center” 
          or you can search for it using the search bar. Once you locate it you will double click on it and that will add 
          it to your project. Now you will be able to utilize GameKit inside of your project.

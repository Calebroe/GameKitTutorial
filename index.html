        GameKit enriches iOS games by enabling social gaming features. 
        It's crucial for engaging users in a more interactive and competitive environment. 
        For a game like 2048, GameKit can significantly enhance the gaming experience 
        by adding a social dimension through leaderboards and achievements, 
        motivating players to improve their skills and engage more deeply with the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 2048 game, a simple yet addictive puzzle, will integrate GameKit to enhance user 
        engagement through the Game Center. We'll add achievements for reaching key milestones 
        (like achieving the 2048 tile), and leaderboards to foster a competitive environment. 
        This will not only increase the game’s replayability but also leverage the social aspect 
        of gaming by allowing players to compare their scores with friends and the global player base.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
        This section will delve into the specifics of adding GameKit features to the 2048 game, 
        demonstrating how to make a simple game more engaging and competitive.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
          We'll use the latest Xcode version and Swift 5, targeting iOS 14 and above. 
          We'll guide you through setting up GameKit in your project, 
          ensuring you have all the necessary tools and dependencies installed.
          <br>
          In order to add Game Center to your app you will first need to create an app on App Store Connect. 
          This will require that you have an Apple Developer account. Once you have logged in you will go 
          to the “My Apps” section and create a new app. In this creation you will link the app using 
          your unique “bundle identifier” which you can find inside your XCode project under “Signing & Capabilities.
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="assets/img/xcode_signup.PNG" alt="XCode Sign in">
          <br>
          While creating your app, make sure to give it permissions for “Game Center”. 
          For the purposes of this tutorial the app will require no other permissions other than Game Center.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now that your app has been created you will need to add Game Center to the app itself inside of Xcode. 
          To do this you will again go to the “Signing & Capabilities” page under your project. Once here you will 
          need to click on the “Team” dropdown menu and, if you haven’t added your account yet, you will need to 
          add your account. After your account has been added you will need to select it in this dropdown menu. 
          Now, you will click on the “+ Capability” button which can be found near the top-left of the image above.
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="assets/img/xcode_signup_2.PNG" alt="XCode Sign in">
          <br>
          This will bring up the capabilities search menu. You can either scroll through the options and find “Game Center” 
          or you can search for it using the search bar. Once you locate it you will double click on it and that will add 
          it to your project. Now you will be able to utilize GameKit inside of your project.
          <br>

        <h2>Integration</h2>
        <p class="content">
        <br>
        For ease of access we recommend putting the Game Center code in its own file and class. 
        This step is optional but will make the code much more readable and clean. You will then be able 
        to create @StateObject variables of the class in the other files that need to access the functions and data. 
        The class will need to be of type ObservableObject and can be outlined like so:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          class GameCenterHandler: ObservableObject {}          
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
        When creating a separate class for all of the Game Center handling like this 
        it is important  to make sure that only a single instance of the class is created 
        and passed around. To accomplish this we will create a singleton like so:
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          static let shared = GameCenterHandler()         
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
        This “shared” variable will allow us to access this single instance of the GameCenterHandler class. 
        From here we will need two more variables before we can authenticate our player. Those being a variable
        containing the local player themself and a variable of type @Published to track whether the 
        authentication view needs to be presented. This can be done like so:</p>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          var localPlayer = GKLocalPlayer.local
          @Published var isPresentingAuthView = false
        </code></pre>
        <br> 
        <p class="content">
        From here we are now ready to authenticate the local player. This is done using the GKLocalPlayer.local
        instance property of “.authenticateHandler”. The authenticateHandler takes a completionHandler that 
        gives two parameters with them being a viewController and an error. The viewController will have a 
        value containing the view for the Game Center authentication if the user is not authenticated and a 
        value of nil if they are authenticated. Likewise, the error will have a value if there is an error 
        or nil if there is none. We can assign this property inside of the init() function like so:</p>
        <br>
        <br> 
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          init() {
            localPlayer.authenticateHandler = { viewController, error in
                if viewController != nil {
                    // Set value to present view controller to authenticate user
                    GameCenterHandler.shared.isPresentingAuthView = true
                } else if self.localPlayer.isAuthenticated {
                     // Player is authenticated
                } else {
                    // Handle error
                    print(error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
                    return
                }
            }
        }    
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p class="content">
        There are four main states we need to check for inside of the authenticateHandler, 
        with those being: if the viewController is not null, if the user is authenticated, 
        if the user isn’t authenticated, and if there is an error. The first is so we can 
        set the flag variable we created earlier to true in order to bring up the Game Center
        authentication view. Next, we check if the player is authenticated or not and inside 
        of this check we can check for if the user has some restrictions placed on their Game 
        Center account. These restrictions can be things like multiplayer restrictions or social 
        restrictions. Next, we check if the player is not authenticated. In this we can choose to 
        warn the user or limit game functionality or force them to retry. Finally, we check to see 
        if there is an error and handle it properly. The order of these checks are somewhat 
        interchangeable but in general you should check for the viewController before checking 
        if the user is authenticated. You may also omit some of them if you have no need to do 
        anything more inside of the check such as how the check for if the player is authenticated 
        is empty in the example code above.</p>

      </section>
      <section id="leaderboards">
        <h2>Leaderboards</h2>
        <p class="content">
        Now, we will go back to the App Store Connect page for your app. 
        Once inside of your app you will then go to the “Services” tab 
        and on the left make sure you are under “Game Center”. From this location
        we can now add leaderboards and achievements following the instructions below.
        <br>
        Scroll down to find the “Leaderboard” section. In this section you will want 
        to click the “+” icon next to the title to create a new leaderboard.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/leaderboard.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
        <br>
        This will bring up a new screen asking the type of leaderboard you want to create. 
        For this tutorial we will be focusing on the “Classic Leaderboard” type so select that.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/leaderboard_setup.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
        <br>
        On the next screen you will be presented with two more sections you will need to fill out. 
        The first will require that you input a “Leaderboard Reference Name”, “LeaderboardID”, 
        the “Score Format Type”, the “Score Submission Type”, the “Sort Order”, and an optional 
        “Score Range”. The “Leaderboard Reference Name” is the name that will appear inside of 
        the App Store Connect page. The “LeaderboardID” is an identifier that you will use to 
        access the leaderboard inside of your code. The “Score Format Type” is the variable type 
        that you want the leaderboard to use for its values. The “Score Submission Type” can either 
        be the highest value or the most recent value. This is a personal preference for how you 
        want your app’s leaderboard set up. The “Sort Order” is also a personal preference of sorting 
        the leaderboard from low to high or high to low. Finally, there is the optional “Score Range” 
        that will limit the values that can be input into the leaderboard. You may have noticed a 
        checkbox at the top labeled “Archived” and this is a toggleable value that will disable the 
        leaderboard from Game Center so users no longer have access to it. The leaderboard will still 
        be on the App Store Connect page with all of the data but cannot be accessed by users until 
        the box is unchecked again.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/leaderboard_setup2.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
        <br>
        The next section is for “Leaderboard Localization”. In this section you will need to 
        add one or more language localizations for your leaderboard. After selecting the 
        “Add Language” button you will be presented with a new pop-up with the fields “Language”,
        “Name”, “Score Format”, “Score Format Suffix”, “Score Format Suffix (Plural)”, and an optional “Image”.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/leaderboard_setup3.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
        <br>
        First, select the language you want to use for this localization. Next, for the “Name” you 
        will put in what you want the leaderboard’s name that will be displayed to the user. Next, 
        the “Score Format” will be how the data is displayed on your app. For example, if it is 
        money you will want it to be in the language’s typical currency. Next, both the “Score Format 
        Suffix” and the plural version are additional text values that you can choose to enter. These 
        will be placed next to the scores entered into the leaderboard so you can do things such as 
        “1000 cookies” if you entered “cookies” for the plural version and “cookie” for the non-plural.
        Finally, you may upload an image that will be displayed as the icon for the leaderboard.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/img/leaderboard_setup4.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
        <br>
        After setting up as many language localizations that you want you can now save the leaderboard you created and move on to code.
        <br>
        <br>
        Once you are back in Xcode you will want to go back to the GameCenterHandler we created earlier. 
        In here we will now want to create a function for reporting/uploading the score to the Game Center 
        leaderboard we just created. To do this we will create a function called reportScore that takes 
        in two parameters of the score type Int and the leaderboardID type String. This can be done like so:
        <br>
        <br>
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          func reportScore(score: Int, leaderboardID: String) {}
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        The first step we will want to take inside this function is to check to make sure that the 
        user is authenticated. This can be done using a simple if-statement to check the 
        isAuthenticated field. We can do this either on the “GKLocalPlayer.local” or 
        on the variable we created earlier of “localPlayer”. For example:
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          if localPlayer.isAuthenticated {
          } else {}       
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Now we are ready to work on reporting the score. First, we will create a “GKLeaderboardScore()” 
        object as a variable and assign three of its properties. The properties that we need to assign 
        are the “leaderboardID”, the “value”, and the “player”. These will be assigned using the parameters 
        that we pass to this function and the global variable of the localPlayer. This can be done like so:
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          let leaderboardScore = GKLeaderboardScore()
            leaderboardScore.leaderboardID = leaderboardID
            leaderboardScore.value = score
            leaderboardScore.player = self.localPlayer   
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Now, similar to how we used the “.authenticateHandler” property, we will use the 
        “GKLeaderboard.loadLeaderboards” property here. This property takes in two parameters of a string
         array of IDs and a completion handler with two parameters of an array of GKLeaderboard and an 
         error. For the first parameter that we need to give we will simply give an array with one value
          of our leaderboardID. Once inside of the “.loadLeaderboards” property, we will need to check 
          two conditions. First, if there is an error. This can be done by checking to see if the error 
          parameter is not nil. Second, if the leaderboard exists. This can be done by checking if the 
          leaderboards parameter is also not nil. This can be done like so:
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            GKLeaderboard.loadLeaderboards(IDs: [leaderboardID]) { (leaderboards, error) in
              if let error = error {
                  print("Error loading leaderboards: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                  return
              }
              guard let leaderboard = leaderboards?.first else {
                  print("Leaderboard not found")
                  return
              }
           }
          </code></pre>
          <br>
          <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Finally, we are ready to attempt to submit the score. This is done using the “GKLeaderboard.submitScore”
        instance property inside of the “.loadLeaderboards” property we have above. The “.submitScore” property
        can be placed below the guard statement. This property takes in the parameters of a “score” of type Int,
        a “context” of type Int, a “player” of type GKPlayer, and a “completionHandler” that gives a parameter 
        of an error. For the “score” we will pass in the “leaderboardScore.value” as an Int. For the context we
        will simply pass in a 0. For the “player” we will pass in the “leaderboardScore.player”. Finally, for 
        the “completionHandler” we will check to see if there is an error or not. All of this can be done like so:
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          GKLeaderboard.submitScore(Int(leaderboardScore.value), context: 0, player: leaderboardScore.player, leaderboardIDs: [leaderboardScore.leaderboardID]) { (error) in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error reporting score: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            } else {
                print("Score reported successfully!")
            }
          }
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Your final reportScore function should look something like so:
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          func reportScore(score: Int, leaderboardID: String) {
            if localPlayer.isAuthenticated {
                let leaderboardScore = GKLeaderboardScore()
                leaderboardScore.leaderboardID = leaderboardID
                leaderboardScore.value = score
                leaderboardScore.player = self.localPlayer
                GKLeaderboard.loadLeaderboards(IDs: [leaderboardID]) { (leaderboards, error) in
                    if let error = error {
                        print("Error loading leaderboards: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                        return
                    }
                    guard let leaderboard = leaderboards?.first else {
                        print("Leaderboard not found")
                        return
                    }
                    GKLeaderboard.submitScore(Int(leaderboardScore.value), context: 0, player: leaderboardScore.player, leaderboardIDs: [leaderboardScore.leaderboardID]) { (error) in
                        if let error = error {
                            print("Error reporting score: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                        } else {
                            print("Score reported successfully!")
                        }
                    }
                }    
              } else {
                print("Player is not authenticated.")
            }
        }    
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Now, you are ready to submit scores to the Game Center leaderboard by calling this function 
        and passing in the score and leaderboardID. For example, we would call this function in our 
        demo 2048 app when a user reaches the game over screen. A call to this function would look something like this:
        <pre><code class="language-swift">
          gameCenterHandler.reportScore(score: score, leaderboardID: "highestScore")
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        This would report the value of “score” to the leaderboard with the ID of “highestScore”.
        That’s all! Now you are ready to create and use leaderboards in your own app!

          Scroll down to find the “Achievements” section. To create a new achievement 
          you will want to click the “+” icon next to the title. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="assets/img/achievements_setup1.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
          <br>
          IMPORTANT NOTE: You can have a maximum of 100 achievements total. There is also 
          a maximum of 1000 points you can allocate to all of your achievements total. 
          <br>
          <br>
          On the next screen you will be presented with two sections you will need to fill out. 
          The first section will have five main fields for you to fill out, with those being: 
          “Achievement Reference Name”, “Achievement ID”, “Point Value”, “Hidden”, and “Achievable 
          More Than Once”. There is also an additional “Archived” toggleable checkbox that works 
          identically to the one that the leaderboards had. This means the achievement will be 
          removed from Game Center and the players will no longer have access to it but it can 
          be re-enabled inside of the App Store Connect at any time.
          <br>
          <br>
          The “Achievement Reference Name” field will be the name shown inside of the App Store
          Connect. The “Achievement ID” will be an identifier that is used to reference the 
          achievement in your code. The “Point Value” field can be a value anywhere from 0-1000 
          and that is how many points this achievement will be worth. It is important to remember 
          that these 1000 points are cumulative for all of your achievements. The “Hidden” field 
          will determine whether the achievement displays its title and pre-earned description or 
          if it will hide this information until the player unlocks it. Finally, the “Achievable 
          More Than Once” field will determine whether players can challenge others to obtain the 
          achievement again even if they have already earned it.
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="assets/img/achievements_setup2.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
          <br>
          <br>
          The next section is the “Achievement Localization” which is very similar to the “Leaderboard
          Localization” we did earlier. You must add one or more language localizations for each 
          achievement. To start we will select “Add Language”. Then, we will be prompted with a 
          screen with five fields to enter. Those fields are: “Language”, “Title”, “Pre-earned 
          Description”, “Earned Description”, and an “Image”. For the “Language” field simply select
          the language of your choice. The “Title” field will be what the achievement will be called
          and what is shown to the user. The “Pre-earned Description” is a short description that 
          will appear to the user under the achievement before they have officially earned it. 
          If the “Hidden” property was set to true then neither the “Title” nor the “Pre-earned 
          Description” will be displayed to the user and instead they will see an achievement simply 
          labeled “Hidden”. The “Earned Description” is another short description but will appear 
          to the user under the achievement after they have officially earned it. Lastly is the “Image” 
          field which is a small image file that will display as the icon for the achievement. 
          Unlike the option leaderboard “Image” field, this “Image” field is required for all achievements.
          <br>
          <br>
          <img src="assets/img/achievements_setup3.PNG" alt="leaderboard plus">
          <br>
          Now you can save the achievement and it will be created. You can repeat this process for as 
          many achievements as you’d like up to a total of 100 achievements with a total of 1000 points. 
          You do not need to create all 100 achievements nor do you need to fill in all 1000 points. 
          Now we can move on to the code.
          <br>
          <br>
          Once you are back in Xcode you will want to go back to the GameCenterHandler we created earlier. 
          In here we will now want to create a function for reporting/uploading achievements to Game Center. 
          To do this we will create a function called reportAchievement that takes in two parameters of the 
          achievementID type String and the percentComplete type Double. This can be done like so:
          <br>
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            func reportAchievement(achievementID: String, percentComplete: Double) {}
          </code></pre>
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Now, once again, inside of this function we will want to ensure that the player is 
          authenticated by performing a simple check. This can be done just the same as the reportScore function, like so:
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            if localPlayer.isAuthenticated {}
          </code></pre>
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Next, we will create a GKAchievement object using the “achievementID” we passed in as 
          the identifier. We will set the property of “.percentComplete” using the “percentComplete” 
          parameter we passed in. The “.showCompletionBanner” property will be set to true which will 
          allow us to display a drop down to the user that lets them know they earned the achievement. 
          For our demo app the achievements are either 0 percent complete or 100 percent complete but 
          you can set progress on achievements as well. If you have achievements that you want to track 
          progress of then you will want an if-statement to check if the “percentComplete” is 100 before 
          setting the “.showsCompletionBanner” to true. All of this can be done like so:
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            let achievement = GKAchievement(identifier: achievementID)
              achievement.percentComplete = percentComplete
              achievement.showsCompletionBanner = true
          </code></pre> 
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Finally, we will use the “.report” function built into the GKAchievement class to report our achievement. 
          This function takes two parameters of an array of type “GKAchievement” and a “completionHandler” that 
          gives an error parameter. We will simply call this function, pass in our GKAchievement object we just 
          created, and check to see if there is an error. This can be done like so:
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            GKAchievement.report([achievement]) { (error) in
              if let error = error {
                  print("Error reporting achievement: \(error.localizedDescription)")
              } else {
                  print("Achievement reported successfully!")
              }
          }      
          </code></pre> 
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Your final reportAchievement function should look something like this:
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            func reportAchievement(achievementID: String, percentComplete: Double) {
              if localPlayer.isAuthenticated {
                  let achievement = GKAchievement(identifier: achievementID)
                  achievement.percentComplete = percentComplete
                  achievement.showsCompletionBanner = true 
                  
                  GKAchievement.report([achievement]) { (error) in
                      if let error = error {
                         print("Error reporting achievement: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                      } else {
                         print("Achievement reported successfully!")
                      }
                  }
              } else {
                  print("Player is not authenticated.")
              }
          }         
          </code></pre> 
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Now you will need to call on this function when you need to report an achievement. 
          It is important to create checks for your achievements in appropriate locations. 
          For example, in our 2048 app we check for achievements in a few different locations. 
          One of those is after each move to check what the highest tile is on the board 
          and to give the player the appropriate achievement for that tile. This is done like so:
          <pre><code class="language-swift">
            checkForHighestTile()
        
            if highestTile >= 256 {
                gameCenterHandler.reportAchievement(achievementID: "tile256", percentComplete: 100)
            }
            if highestTile >= 512 {
                gameCenterHandler.reportAchievement(achievementID: "tile512", percentComplete: 100)
            }
            if highestTile >= 1024 {
                gameCenterHandler.reportAchievement(achievementID: "tile1024", percentComplete: 100)
            }
            if highestTile >= 2048 {
                gameCenterHandler.reportAchievement(achievementID: "tile2048", percentComplete: 100)
            }
          </code></pre> 
          <br>
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          These calls will report the achievements using the given identifiers and all with 100 percent completion.
          That’s all! Now you are ready to create and use achievements in your own app!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Showing Leaderboards and Achievements</h2>
          <p class="content">
            Now that we have properly setup and configured our code to enable and populate the Leaderboard
            and Achievement overlays in Game Center, we want to make sure the user can open and display these.
            We decided we would set this up by including buttons on our main menu screen, another alternative is to configure
            your GameCenterHandler to present the GameCenter Overlay as a widget on select screens or all the screens.
            Using the button approach is quite simple. First we create two functions we can call inside our MainScreen.swift 
            that utilize the game state, setting to our GameCenterDelegate, and presenting to the rootViewController to display:
            <pre><code class="language-swift">
              // Function to show the achievements viewController
              private func showAchievements() {
                  guard let rootViewController = UIApplication.shared.windows.first?.rootViewController else { return }
                  // Create GameCenterViewController with the state of .achievements
                  let achievementsViewController = GKGameCenterViewController(state: .achievements)
                  achievementsViewController.gameCenterDelegate = gameCenterDelegate
                  // Present the achievementsViewController
                  rootViewController.present(achievementsViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
              }

              // Function to show the leaderboard viewController
              private func showLeaderboard() {
                  guard let rootViewController = UIApplication.shared.windows.first?.rootViewController else { return }
                  // Create GameCenterViewController with the state of .leaderboards
                  let leaderboardViewController = GKGameCenterViewController(state: .leaderboards)
                  leaderboardViewController.gameCenterDelegate = gameCenterDelegate
                  // Hardcode the leaderboardIdentifier since we only have one leaderboard
                  leaderboardViewController.leaderboardIdentifier = "highestScore"
                  // Present the leaderboardViewController
                  rootViewController.present(leaderboardViewController, animated: true, completion: nil)
              }
            </code></pre> 
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Now the last thing to do is create the buttons in a SwiftUI Vstack:
            <pre><code class="language-swift">
              // Lower Leaderboard and Achievements buttons
                VStack {
                    HStack {
                        Button("LeaderBoard") {
                            // Action to show leaderboard
                            showLeaderboard()
                        }
                        .padding()

                        Button("Achievements") {
                            // Action to show achievements
                            showAchievements()
                        }
                        .padding()
                    }
                    .padding(.bottom, 0) // Moves the HStack lower down on the screen
                }
            </code></pre> 
            <br>
            <br>
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Finally, here is what our new LeaderBoard and Achievement overlays look like after implementing:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="image-container">
              <img src="/assets/img/simulator_leaderboards.png" alt="Leaderboard" class="side-by-side">
              <img src="/assets/img/simulator_achievements.png" alt="Achievement" class="side-by-side">
